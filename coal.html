        The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneath the towering
        smokestacks of four coal-fired power plants. A fifth plant has been
        proposed, the latest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets
        electricity.

        Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
        plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by
        uncertain economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of the
        plants to be abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court systems.

        One such coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is already
        surrounded by four coal-fired power plants. American Municipal Power has
        proposed building a new Meigs County coal plant, slated to begin
        construction late this year or in early 2010.

        The following information provides background to explain why coal plants
        are at the center of a national debate over energy production and
        consumption.
