        The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneath the towering
        smokestacks of four coal-fired power plants. A fifth plant has been
        proposed, the latest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets
        electricity.

        Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
        plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by
        uncertain economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of the
        plants to be abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court systems.

        One such coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is already
        surrounded by four coal-fired power plants. American Municipal Power has
        proposed building a new Meigs County coal plant, slated to begin
        construction late this year or in early 2010.

        The following information provides background to explain why coal plants
        are at the center of a national debate over energy production and
        consumption.

      What’s the connection between coal and electricity?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal. Coal-fired power
        plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to turn the turbines
        of an electrical generator. The U.S. has one of the largest coal
        reserves in the world and burns it at about 600 plants across the
        nation. Generating electricity from coal is common in the South and in
        the heartland, but less often used in regions such as the West Coast,
        where hydroelectricity and natural gas are bigger sources of power.

      If coal is so important to electricity generation, why are some people
      concerned about building new coal-fired power plants?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Coal plants emit carbon dioxide, a major ingredient in climate change.
        In recent years, NASA climate scientist James Hansen has advocated a
        moratorium on building new coal plants until technology is developed to
        prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere. Hansen has
        warned that continuing to release carbon dioxide at current rates – even
        just for the next 10 years – will create “a different planet – one
        without sea ice in the Arctic; with worldwide, repeated coastal
        tragedies associated with storms and a continuously rising sea level.”
        The proposed American Municipal Power plant in Meigs County would
        release an estimated 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide annually,
        according to CARMA, a nonprofit group.

      Why are there so many electricity-generating coal plants near Meigs
      County?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s history. The
        county’s newest mine began producing coal last February. An experimental
        site for carbon capture and sequestration, a technology to store carbon
        dioxide underground, is under construction in West Virginia near Meigs
        County's southern border. In addition, a coal-to-liquids facility and
        two other coal-fired power plants have been proposed for the region,
        although at least some of those plans appear to be on hold. Meanwhile,
        Meigs County is one of the poorest counties in Ohio, according to 2000
        U.S. Census data. Elisa Young, a Meigs County resident who has organized
        opposition to the new plant, argues that poverty reduces local
        opposition to the coal industry. “When you have an economy that's
        entirely wrapped around coal, you can't speak out about it,” she says.

      Some Meigs County residents are concerned about the health effects of coal
      plants. Why?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        In 2007, the four existing coal plants near Meigs County released
        millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, including arsenic, chromium,
        manganese, mercury, sulfuric acid aerosols and selenium, according to
        the Environmental Protection Agency. Each of these chemicals has been
        linked to human health problems, such as cancer, gastrointestinal
        disorders, impaired motor skills and neurological damage. Kent Carson, a
        spokesperson for American Municipal Power, said the proposed plant will
        use new technology to control pollutants. “This will be the cleanest
        facility of its type in the state,” he said.

    <button class="accordion">
      Can it be proved that the coal plants are responsible for health problems
      in Meigs County?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        It can be hard to prove that any one of the chemicals caused health
        problems of a particular individual. “We’re exposed to a soup of
        chemicals,” said Kevin Crist, director of the Center for Air Quality at
        Ohio University. Crist said health problems can be influenced by
        interactions between chemicals, as well as by lifestyle factors. In
        addition, low income – a common characteristic in Meigs County – is
        correlated with health problems. One reason is that poor people are more
        likely to smoke than their wealthier counterparts. More than 30 percent
        of adult residents of Southeast Ohio smoke, compared to only about 25
        percent of residents of other Ohio counties. Crist said tall smokestacks
        on the existing plants probably disperse most pollutants away from Meigs
        County. But he said it is impossible to know for sure what residents are
        being exposed to, because no agency monitors the county’s air.

    <button class="accordion">
      So what do we know about air quality and health in Meigs County?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        An analysis by USA Today estimated that the air quality at Southern
        Elementary School in Meigs County is worse than the air quality at 97
        percent of the nation's schools. USA Today identified two of the coal
        plants near Meigs County as major contributors to pollution at the
        school. In addition, men in Meigs County have the lowest life expectancy
        among men in any Ohio county, according to data compiled by Harvard
        University (women ranked 26th worst of 88 counties). Meigs County also
        has the highest death rate of any Ohio county for lung and bronchus
        cancer, according to the Ohio Department of Health.

    <button class="accordion">
      Despite the suspected health effects, wouldn’t a new plant create
      much-needed jobs?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Blue-collar labor is especially important in Meigs County, where fewer
        than 5 percent of adult residents hold college degrees and more than 25
        percent have no high school diploma, according to the Ohio Office of
        Policy, Research and Strategic Planning. In 2007, Meigs County's median
        income was $27,287, about half the national average. Many Meigs County
        residents support the new plant for the jobs it may bring to the
        community. Construction worker Greg Sheets has testified in favor of the
        plant at public hearings. “My family will benefit by me going up there
        and working,” he said. “If I reached in your pocket and took $200,000
        out of your pocket, would you like it?” he said, referring to the income
        he estimated he could earn during the four years it would take to build
        the plant. But no one can guarantee how many jobs will actually go to
        Meigs County residents or how much they will pay. “We all know that not
        all the workers are going to come from Meigs County,” said Sheets, the
        construction worker. “They’ll be from all over the country.”

    <button class="accordion">What’s next?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Before construction can begin on a new coal plant, an energy company
        must receive pollution permits from a state regulatory authority.
        Carson, the American Municipal Power spokesman, said his utility has
        received all the permits it needs and that construction on the plant
        will start in late 2009 or early 2010. Opponents of the plant have
        appealed the plant’s permits. The state of Ohio will allow construction
        to proceed during the appeals process.
